          Mycelium represents life, death, and peace all through its own actions. Humanity may not be able to control the rest of humanity, but we can learn to control ourselves. We can grow in the presence of doom, we can choose peace through our actions. We have the incredible privilege to experience existence through the lense of a human. This is not to be mistaken as "easy," but regarded as an opportunity to experience a spectrum of what it is to be alive. Inherently, this spectrum requires the ability to face death, and if you allow yourself, birth life.
